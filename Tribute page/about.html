        <h4 class="headline">About Heneral Antonio Luna:</h4>
        <p class="about">
          Heneral Antonio Luna was a prominent Filipino general during the Philippine-American War. Known for his fierce
          temperament and strategic military mind, he played a crucial role in the fight against American colonization.
          Luna was not only a military leader but also a skilled pharmacist and an advocate for the establishment of a
          national army. Despite his contributions, he faced internal conflicts and rivalries within the revolutionary
          ranks, which ultimately led to his assassination in 1899. His legacy as a national hero continues to inspire
          many Filipinos today.
